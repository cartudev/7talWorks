## Background

This add-on started as a solution to improve the time wasted on designing and counting all the elements for the construction of an expo. I initially tried using Rhino and a system of blocks, which was effective for counting, but Rhino's rendering capabilities were not satisfactory. After testing various solutions such as game engines and BIM software, I realized that Blender's philosophy was the best fit for my development solutions. If you want to adapt your own modular system, you can use this project as inspiration. It is simple to edit and create your own modular building system.


## Usage

1. Install the plugin.
2. In the 3D viewport, navigate to the "7Tal Works" tab.
3. Within the "7Tal Works" tab, access the "Build" paneling option.
4. Choose an object, such as the starter cube, and set the desired properties in the "Type" column, starting with a column value of 2500.
5. Adjust the direction property if needed, and then click the button below.
6. You can now add boards to your project. Each board automatically adds the required profiles. Specify the desired quantity of boards.
7. Finally, you can obtain the object count by following these steps:
    * Set the file name and file path for the count result in the Object Properties section.
    * Click the "Count Objects" button.
    * These options can be found under Object Properties > Objects Counter.

## Installation

1. Download add-on (zipped) from the release file.
2. In blender, go to : Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons -> Install.
3. Select the downloaded file and you're good to go.


## Features
